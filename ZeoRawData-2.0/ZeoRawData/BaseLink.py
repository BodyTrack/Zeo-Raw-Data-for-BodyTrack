"""
BaseLink
--------

Listens to the data coming from the serial port connected to Zeo.

The serial port is set at baud 38400, no parity, one stop bit.
Data is sent Least Significant Byte first.

The serial protocol is: 
    * AncllLLTttsid
    
        * A  is a character starting the message
        * n  is the protocol "version", ie "4"
        * c  is a one byte checksum formed by summing the identifier byte and all the data bytes
        * ll is a two byte message length sent LSB first. This length includes the size of the data block plus the identifier.
        * LL is the inverse of ll sent for redundancy. If ll does not match ~LL, we can start looking for the start of the next block immediately, instead of reading some arbitrary number of bytes, based on a bad length.
        * T  is the lower 8 bits of Zeo's unix time.
        * tt is the 16-bit sub-second (runs through 0xFFFF in 1second), LSB first.
        * s  is an 8-bit sequence number.
        * i  is the datatype
        * d  is the array of binary data

The incoming data is cleaned up into packets containing a timestamp,
the raw data output version, and the associated data.

External code can be sent new data as it arrives by adding 
themselves to the callback list using the addCallBack function.
It is suggested, however, that external code use the ZeoParser to
organize the data into events and slices of data.
